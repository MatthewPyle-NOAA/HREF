# HREF

Contains the workflow and codes and other files needed to run the High Resolution Ensemble Forecast (HREF) system.  
This package is the basis for what will become HREFv3.0 at some point in 2020.

Very simple setup instructions (just for WCOSS-Cray):

cd href.v3.0.0/sorc/

./build_href.sh 

./install_href.sh (to copy executables to exec/)

./link_href.sh  (to populate fix files)
